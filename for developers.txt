The project is running on Qt.
Each module's code is independent from other modules' codes(except for parameter-passing code, of course).
After 22 november release all compiled GUI files must be manifest-injected.
Ask Liliya-Tazieva to do this if you want to commit some changes to GUI.
Code must be compiled in 32 bit.
You can also use testhex folder in executables for testing.
