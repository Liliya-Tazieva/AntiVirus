##Test data
###How to use:
Testhex folder contains some files to scan, with them you can test russian simbols support, masks support, heuristics and md5 scan. 
You can compile and use "virus-hosts-rtp-test" contents to test "hosts" file protection feature(beware, it puts trash in your "hosts" file if not protected).
